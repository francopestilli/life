# --- The parameters used to simulate the DW-MR images emanating from the strands. ---
#
# Please enter parameter names on separate lines (with no preceding space) followed by a single space
 and then its value. Lines without recognised parameter names in this format will be ignored. 
#
# E.g. 
# name 0.0 		(Remember, NO preceding space and only ONE space between name and value!)
# 
#
# NB: The generated phantom is scale invariant.  All parameters representing spatial quantities are only 
relative to one another and therefore defined in abstract units (U).
#



noise_level 0.014818			# The sigma parameter in the Rician noise model (i.e. the standard 
						deviation of the Gaussian noise added to the real and
						 imaginary components of the simulated signal)

output_format analyze			# The output format in which the images will be saved in (and read
						 from)
